- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlkaVuica. Well, not actually *thee* Alka Vuica, but if you're acquainted with her work and find this funny, we might share a sense of humor. My name is Filip :)
- 👀 I’m interested in sharing some of my code bits and searching for other people's interesting contribution to this community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some advanced Python skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything. If it sounds fun, why not?
